<br>
The required static data has been extracted from the static data provided at the https://otd.delhi.gov.in/data/static/.

The extracted data has been stored using shelve object and stored in the myData.bak, myData.dat and myData.dir files.
The python code written for extraction is contained in the file named extract.py.

The entire data management has been done purely using shelves in python as the data size was small.
